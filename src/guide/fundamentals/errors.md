# Errors

<img :src="$withBase('/img/security.png')" style="width:60%; float: right; margin-right: 70px;"> In Docplanner we're using standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error which has failed given the information provided (e.g., resource is no longer available, request doesn't contain all the required fields, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` and codes in the `5xx` range indicate a server-side error.

### HTTP Status Codes

Below, find the list of all the conventional HTTP status codes with line of coment:

| **500, 502, 503, 504** - Server error | Docplanner server is not operative at the moment <br />(should happen very rarely) |

Every response has specific Content-Type header:

```json
Content-Type: application/vnd.error+docplanner+json
```

### Custom error messages

In the real-time booking flow we allow making the booking functionality dependent of the response to a synchronous call during the process (read more here /link/).  

In our interface the system might display custom error message informing patient about the reason of failure on response to error code from `4XX` family and header `Content-Type: application/json` . Body of the response must contain specific `error_code` defined in a dictionary provided to Integrations Support (via email to integrations@docplanner.com).

```json
{
    "error_code": 1
}
```
