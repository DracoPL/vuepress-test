# Rate Limits

In order to prevent DOS/DDOS attacks and abuses of the API, we use **rate limitting**. Currently the rate limits are set on 2 levels:


- Limitting the requests quota **per hour**


- Limiting WRITE (PUT, POST, DELETE) requests **per minute**
  
  

In case of justified needs, the limits can be increased as they are set on client level. In order to disucss it, contact us at integrations@docplanner.com

If your limits reaches zero, subsequent requests will receive the `429 Too Many Requests` response code until the request reset time has been reached.


:::tip What if I don't get the parameters in headers?

No rate limiter specific headers in API responses means that the rate limitter has been disabled

We inform you of the state of rate limiter using HTTP headers. 

- **X-RateLimit-Limit**

  Request limit for the current time span

- **X-RateLimit-Reset**

  Rate limiter reset date in in [ISO8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format

- **X-RateLimit-Used**

  Number of requests made in current time span

- **X-RateLimit-Remaining**

  Number of requests remaining in current time span

 We highly recommend an exponential backoff of your requests in case of reaching rate limits.
